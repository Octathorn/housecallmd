    },
    {
      question: "How often does the provider come out to visit?",
      answer: "Visit frequency depends on your medical needs and care plan. Some patients require weekly visits, while others may need monthly check-ups. We'll work with you to determine the appropriate schedule."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need an urgent appointment?",
      answer: "For urgent care needs, we offer same-day appointments when possible. Call us and we'll work to accommodate your schedule and medical needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have to go to the hospital?",

    },
    {
      question: "Will I have the same provider every visit?",
      answer: "We strive to provide continuity of care with the same provider whenever possible. However, there may be times when a different provider is available due to scheduling or coverage needs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I still see my regular doctor?",
      answer: "Yes, you can continue seeing your regular doctor. We work collaboratively with your existing healthcare providers to ensure coordinated care."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I do if I need labs, X-rays, or diagnostic tests?",
      answer: "We can order and coordinate lab work, X-rays, and other diagnostic tests. Many tests can be performed in your home, while others may require a visit to a local facility."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you come out for emergency visits?",
      answer: "We provide urgent care services but are not a substitute for emergency medical services. For true emergencies, please call 911. We can provide follow-up care after emergency treatment."

    {
      question: "How do I arrange to be treated in my home?",
      answer: "Simply call us to schedule an appointment. We'll discuss your medical needs, verify insurance coverage, and arrange a convenient time for a provider to visit your home."
